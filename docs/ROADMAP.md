# Alaska Adventure – 2-Week Roadmap (MVP)

## Week 1
- [ ] **Core loop**: click-to-move, 2–3 hotspots (bush → berries, radio → needs power, wreckage → scrap).
- [ ] **UI pass**: HUD tidy + toggleable inventory (I).
- [ ] **Day/Night**: 90s tint cycle + clock label in UI.
- [ ] **Autosave**: localStorage `af_save_v1` for player/inventory; `[N]` New Game hotkey.
- [ ] **Docs**: `README` quickstart, `TODO.md` backlog.

## Week 2
- [ ] **JSON-driven content**: `/data/hotspots.json`, `/data/items.json` to define hotspots & rewards.
- [ ] **Light crafting**: combine Scrap + Berries → “Makeshift Bait” (stub).
- [ ] **Quest notes**: tiny log panel; “Radio needs power” becomes first quest.
- [ ] **Polish**: sound stubs, simple transitions, small bug fixes.
- [ ] **Ops**: GitHub Action link-check for Pages, nightly.

## Stretch
- [ ] Weather tint (snow/wind cues), region selector, minigame stub.
